Instructions for using Git:
•	git clone put url here.  This will be how you get the Github repo.
Todo before you change ANYTHING in the files:
•	git fetch; This sends a request to the server to look for differences. Will check all branches.
•	git pull;  This pulls the updated file from the server and incorporates it into your local repo.
To submit changes:
•	git status;  Checks for saved changes in your local repo that have not been added to the staging area or index.
•	git add <filename>; adds the specified file’s changes to staging area.
•	git add –A; adds all changes to the staging area.
•	git commit –m “insert commit message”; submits the changes to your own repo and creates a message.
•	git push origin <branchname>; pushes the current commits to the online repo.
